# Motion-Induced Blindness and Motion Aftereffect

## Overview

This repository a programme for exploring Motion-Induced Blindness (MIB) and Motion Aftereffect (MAE). MIB refers to the phenomenon where visual stimuli disappear when there's a moving pattern present. MAE, on the other hand, is the perception of motion in the opposite direction after prolonged exposure to a moving stimulus.

### Code

The repository includes code used for running experiments related to MIB and MAE. This includes:

- Experiment setup and protocols for studying MIB disappearance with moving patterns.
- Protocols for inducing MAE and analyzing its effects on visual perception.
