      Motion-Induced Blindness (MIB) is when you can't see something even though it's right in front of you, and it happens when there's a moving pattern. People have suggested different reasons for this, like the brain being busy with other things or visual illusions. In our study, we want to figure out if the way things appear to move can make things disappear.
  
      We also talk about another thing called Motion Aftereffect (MAE), where if you look at something moving for a long time and then look at something still, it looks like it's moving in the opposite direction. We're trying to understand how this happens in the brain.
        
      We think that understanding how things look when they move can help us understand why things disappear with Motion-Induced Blindness.
